#Why OpenWeather

We chose the OpenWeather API to show current weather in user posts 
that have the location tagged and stored. This way, the user will have
an easier time deciding if they want to go to this place. If the 
weather is good, and they are close by, the idea is that this display
will help prompt the user to visit this location and take panoramas of
their own, and ideally keep user engagement up. 

#Why not other APIs for the demo?
Our team thought it best to add something dynamic
to the application that wouldn't just be an 
add-on or bonus feature. All photos have to be
taken somewhere, and people love visiting places...
we thought a great way to help make the visiting process
easier, would be to show the current weather at said location!
At the moment, this seemed like the most interesting
non-add-on that was relevant to our app, View.
